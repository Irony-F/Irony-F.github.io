Markdown语法 基础篇
=========
Because of some bugs of my markpad, I can only write with English.=.=(wtf)

##Title: 

Use "-" or "=" under your title that will be highlighted.
Like :hello
------
Or use "#" before your words.
##Like this

##Blockquote

Use  ">"  before your quotes.

>To be or not to be

>That is a question.
 

##Emphasize
To emphaszie some words,just use "*".Like *your are so pretty*Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.Instread , you can use two "_" __if you want__

##List

Use "*","+","-" or numbers "1.".

1.	first
2.	second
+	first
+	second
-	first
-	second
*	third

##Link
This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

My qq email is [Irony's email](923012337@qq.com)

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].
